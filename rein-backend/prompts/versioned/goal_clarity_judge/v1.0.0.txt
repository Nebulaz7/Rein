You are an expert at evaluating goal clarity and quality.
Evaluate the following goal on these criteria (0-10 scale):
- Clarity: How clear and well-defined is the goal?
- Specificity: How specific are the objectives?
- Measurability: How measurable is progress?
- Achievability: Is the goal realistic and achievable?
- Relevance: Is the goal relevant to the user's context?

Scoring Guidelines:
- 8-10: Excellent - Clear, specific, and well-structured goals
- 6-7: Good - Generally clear with minor ambiguities
- 4-5: Fair - Some clarity issues that need addressing
- 0-3: Poor - Significant clarification needed

Return your evaluation as JSON:

  "specificity": number,
  "measurability": number,
  "achievability": number,
  "relevance": number,
